# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

MyWhisper is a Windows, SuperWhisper-style local Hebrew dictation tool. The user presses a global hotkey anywhere, speaks Hebrew, and the speech is transcribed **locally on the GPU** via `faster-whisper` (with punctuation) and auto-pasted into the focused text field. No internet, no API costs. The README is in Hebrew and is the primary user-facing doc.

## Commands

All Python runs through the isolated venv (`.venv`, Python 3.12 — the ML stack lacks 3.14 wheels). Run from the project root.

```powershell
# One-time setup: creates .venv (Python 3.12) and installs deps incl. CUDA libs
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup.ps1

# Sanity check: records 4s from the mic and transcribes (verifies GPU + Hebrew)
# First run downloads the Whisper model (~1.5-3 GB)
.\.venv\Scripts\python app\check_gpu.py

# Run the app
.\.venv\Scripts\python app\main.py

# Run silently to tray (no console window)
wscript scripts\run_mywishper.vbs

# Create Desktop shortcut (creates MyWhisper.lnk on Desktop)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\create_desktop_shortcut.ps1

# Install/remove Windows autostart (creates MyWhisper.lnk in Startup folder)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install_autostart.ps1
```

```powershell
# Unit tests (corrections + history layers)
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m unittest discover tests
```

No linter is configured. `app/check_gpu.py` is the manual smoke test for the transcription pipeline; `app/model_check.py` / `app/gpu_infer_check.py` are similar diagnostics. Runtime logs go to `mywhisper.log` (UTF-8, rotating) via `app/applog.py`.

## Architecture

`app/main.py` is the orchestrator. `Mywishper` wires the components and runs a toggle-based state machine driven by the global hotkey:

1. `HotkeyManager` (`hotkey.py`) registers one global hotkey via the native Win32 `RegisterHotKey` API (not the `keyboard` lib, whose low-level hook is silently blocked by security software on some machines). WM_HOTKEY messages are caught on the Qt main thread via a `QAbstractNativeEventFilter` bound to a hidden host window (`_ensure_host`), de-duplicated (Qt delivers each message to filters twice), and routed to `Mywishper.toggle` (idle → recording → transcribing → idle). `rebind()` re-registers live from the settings UI; `TempHotkey` registers Esc only while recording. The toggle callback runs on the GUI thread, so the max-record cap uses a `QTimer` (not `threading.Timer`).
2. First press: `Recorder.start()` (`recorder.py`, `sounddevice`) captures mic audio; start beep; tray + overlay turn red. UI/tray updates from the hotkey/worker threads are marshaled to the Qt main thread via signals.
3. Second press: `Recorder.stop()` returns samples; transcription runs on a worker thread (`_worker`) so the UI stays responsive.
4. `Transcriber.transcribe()` (`transcriber.py`) runs `faster-whisper` on GPU (`cuda`/`float16`, falls back to CPU/`int8`; CPU uses `beam_size_cpu` greedy for speed). The model loads lazily (`load`/`ensure_loaded`) and can be freed (`unload`) — `main._resource_poll` (a 5s GUI-thread `QTimer`) releases it after `idle_release_minutes` idle or while a fullscreen app is foreground (`fullscreen.foreground_is_fullscreen`), reloading transparently on next use. `transcriber._add_cuda_dll_dirs()` injects the pip CUDA DLL folders into the DLL search path before importing `faster_whisper` — required or GPU load fails.
5. The result passes through `corrections.apply()` (learning layer, see below), then `paste_text()` (`paste.py`: clipboard + `Ctrl+V`, with optional clipboard restore), and `history.add()`.

Single-instance guard: a named Windows mutex acquired at the top of `main.py` (before the heavy ML imports); a duplicate launch exits instantly.

UI is **PySide6 (Qt)** — chosen over Tkinter because Tk 8.6 has no real bidi/RTL support (Hebrew + embedded English rendered scrambled and laggy). Qt runs on the **main thread** (`QApplication.exec()` in `main.py`); the tray and hotkey/transcription run off it and talk back via Qt **signals** (`AppUI.set_overlay_state` / `open_settings` / `request_quit` are thread-safe). The app is globally `RightToLeft`. UI layer files:
- `app/theme.py` — design system: `LIGHT`/`DARK` palettes (token dicts), `build_qss(palette)` (one app-wide stylesheet), `pick_font()`. Active theme persisted in config `theme`.
- `app/icons.py` — color-aware line icons drawn with QPainter (`icon(name, color, size)`); no extra deps.
- `app/widgets.py` — reusable `FramelessWindow` (rounded + drop shadow + native edge-resize via `startSystemResize`/`startSystemMove`), `TitleBar` (branded, draggable, theme toggle + min/close), `NavRail` (side nav, emits `selected`), `ToggleSwitch`, `Card`.
- `app/ui.py` — `MainWindow(FramelessWindow)` = title bar + nav rail + `QStackedWidget` of three pages: **היסטוריה** (search + per-card hover copy/delete), **מילון** (learned corrections), **הגדרות** (theme toggle, sound). `AppUI(QObject)` is the controller; `toggle_theme`/`set_theme` rebuild the window with the new palette. History cards are rich-text `QLabel` with `dir="rtl"`; each Hebrew word is an `<a href="idx:tok">` link (`on_word_clicked` → `CorrectionDialog`), unknown words styled red. `Overlay` is the frameless recording HUD.

The tray (`tray.py`) is a native `QSystemTrayIcon`. Sounds (`sounds.py`, generated by `make_sounds.py`) live in `app/assets/`. The main window opens on launch and is forced to the foreground (`SetForegroundWindow`) since a wscript-launched process can't normally grab focus.

Launch detail: `run_mywishper.vbs` starts the **base** interpreter directly with `__PYVENV_LAUNCHER__` set to the venv python, so the app runs as a *single* process (a venv launcher would spawn a second) while keeping the venv's `sys.prefix`/site-packages (so CUDA + wordfreq still resolve).

## Self-improving correction layer (`app/corrections.py`)

The accuracy-learning feature. State lives in two JSON files in the project root: `corrections.json` (`{wrong: right}`) and `dictionary.json` (approved words). Flow:

- **Detect**: `flag_tokens(text)` splits a transcription into tokens; a Hebrew word is flagged "unknown" when it's not approved, not a correction target, and absent from the **wordfreq** Hebrew lexicon (offline) — also trying prefix-stripped forms (ו/ה/ב/כ/ל/מ/ש) to cut false positives. The history UI renders each card as a Qt rich-text `QLabel` (`dir="rtl"`) with each Hebrew word an `<a>` link; unknown words are styled red (gated by config `highlight_unknown`). wordfreq lookups are memoized (`_in_lexicon` lru_cache) and the JSON files are mtime-cached so rendering many cards stays fast.
- **Correct**: clicking a word opens a popup → `add_correction(wrong, right)` (also approves `right`) or `approve_word(word)`. The edited entry is rewritten via `apply_corrections` + `history.update(index, text)`.
- **Learn**: `apply(text)` whole-word-replaces known mistakes on every future transcription; `bias_terms()` feeds approved/corrected vocabulary to `Transcriber.transcribe(audio, hotwords=...)` so Whisper is nudged toward the right words (faster-whisper folds `hotwords` into the prompt alongside `initial_prompt`).

If `wordfreq` is unavailable, detection degrades gracefully (nothing is flagged); the rest still works.

## Config (`config.json`, defaults in `config.py`)

Runtime source of truth is `config.json` (gitignored, per-user; created from the tracked `config.example.json` by `setup.ps1`); `config.py` merges it over `DEFAULTS` (so missing keys are fine). The default hotkey is `ctrl+space` everywhere (DEFAULTS, example, README). Keys: hotkey, model (default `ivrit-ai/whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2`; `large-v3` is the higher-accuracy alternative), language=`he`, device, compute_type, beam_size, vad_filter, restore_clipboard, clipboard_restore_delay, max_record_seconds (Esc cancels a recording; the cap auto-stops a forgotten one), sounds, sound_volume, initial_prompt, highlight_unknown, bidi_isolate, theme.

## GPU / environment notes

- GPU inference needs the NVIDIA CUDA runtime DLLs from the pip packages `nvidia-cuda-runtime-cu12`, `nvidia-cublas-cu12`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` (installed by `setup.ps1`). Without them, `faster-whisper` falls back to (slow) CPU.
- The global hotkey uses native `RegisterHotKey` (no admin needed); `paste.py` injects Ctrl+V via native `keybd_event`. The `keyboard` library is no longer a dependency. If a hotkey combo is already claimed by another app, `RegisterHotKey` fails and the UI/tray surfaces it (pick another combo in Settings).
- Console output can hit Windows `charmap` encoding errors on Hebrew text (see `app_run_log.txt`); this is cosmetic logging, not a transcription failure.
